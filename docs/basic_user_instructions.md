### Basic user instructions

   >Running the app will bring you to the first screen where you can access the app. A stretch goal
    is to give this screen a more personal look with the name of the user being linked to it.
    The second screen gives you the option to choose between four screens (accommodation, itinerary,
    general information and points of interest) display the information from the database.
    Using the return button under the screen will get you back to the previous screen.
